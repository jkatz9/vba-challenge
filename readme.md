# VBA Challenge

## Overview

This repository constitutes my submission for the vba-challenge assignment from module 2.

## Project Structure

- `vba-challenge1.vba`: The main VBA script containing the solution to the challenge. To run this code, I copy and pasted the contents of this file into the VBE in excel, and ran the script on the whole workbook.
- `resources/`: A directory containing the data files to which my script is applied
- `Q\d.png`: screenshots of the completed workbooks.

## Note

I used a snippet from github copilot to dynamically determine the number of rows in each worksheet.
